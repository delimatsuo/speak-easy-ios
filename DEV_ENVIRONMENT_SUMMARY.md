## 🎯 **How to Start Developing RIGHT NOW**

### **Step 1: Set Up Your Environment (One-Time)**
```bash
# Run the automated setup script
./scripts/dev-setup.sh

# This will:
# ✅ Check and install prerequisites
# ✅ Create Python virtual environment  
# ✅ Install all dependencies
# ✅ Set up Docker services
# ✅ Create development configuration
# ✅ Set up pre-commit hooks
```

### **Step 2: Add Your API Keys**
```bash
# Copy the secrets template
cp secrets/.env.secrets.template secrets/.env.secrets

# Edit with your actual keys:
# - GEMINI_API_KEY (from https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
# - Other required secrets
```

### **Step 3: Start Development**
```bash
# Start the development server
./scripts/dev-start.sh

# Your API will be available at:
# 🌐 http://localhost:8080
# 📚 http://localhost:8080/docs
```

### **Step 4: Create a Feature**
```bash
# Create a new feature branch
git checkout develop
git checkout -b feature/your-amazing-feature

# Start coding!
# When done, run tests:
./scripts/test-all.sh

# Commit and push:
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add amazing new feature"
git push -u origin feature/your-amazing-feature

# Create PR: feature/your-amazing-feature → develop
```
