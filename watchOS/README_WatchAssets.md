This folder contains the watchOS asset catalog used by the `UniversalTranslator Watch App` target.

How to wire it in Xcode:

1. Select the `UniversalTranslator Watch App` target.
2. General → App Icons and Launch Screen → App Icon = `AppIcon` (from `WatchAssets.xcassets`).
3. If the dropdown is empty, ensure `WatchAssets.xcassets` is in the target membership of the Watch App target.

Icon files:
- `WatchAssets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset/AppIcon-1024.png` (marketing icon). Replace with your final 1024×1024 PNG if needed.
