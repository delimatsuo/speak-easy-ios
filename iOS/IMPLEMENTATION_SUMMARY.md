- Added comprehensive accessibility support

## üöÄ **Key Improvements Delivered**

### **Responsive Design**
```swift
// Before: Fixed sizing
.frame(width: 150, height: 150)

// After: Adaptive sizing
.responsiveFrame(baseSize: 150) // Scales 0.85x to 1.2x based on device
```

### **Modern Animations**
```swift
// Before: Basic animations  
.animation(.easeInOut, value: state)

// After: iOS 17 spring physics
.animation(ModernAnimations.snappy, value: state)
```

### **Enhanced Accessibility**
```swift
// Before: Limited accessibility
.accessibilityLabel("Button")

// After: Comprehensive support
.accessibleMicrophoneButton(isRecording: isRecording, isProcessing: isProcessing, isPlaying: isPlaying)
```

### **Haptic Feedback Integration**
```swift
// Simple, consistent haptic feedback
HapticFeedback.light()    // Light touch feedback
HapticFeedback.success()  // Success confirmation
HapticFeedback.selection() // Selection changes
```

## üì± **Device Support Matrix**

| Device Category | Screen Sizes | Scale Factor | Key Features |
|-----------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Compact** | iPhone SE | 0.85x | Optimized for small screens |
| **Regular** | iPhone 8, 8+ | 1.0x | Base reference size |
| **Large** | iPhone X, XR, 11 | 1.1x | Enhanced for modern screens |
| **Extra Large** | Pro Max, iPad | 1.2x | Premium large screen experience |

## üé® **Visual Enhancements**

### **Modern Card Styling**
- Proper corner radius scaling (6pt to 24pt based on context)
- Subtle shadows with 0.05 opacity
- Adaptive backgrounds that work in light/dark mode
- Proper visual hierarchy with consistent spacing

### **Advanced Animations**
- **Pulse Effects**: For recording states with multiple concentric rings  
- **Spring Press**: 0.95x scale with snappy spring physics
- **Breathing Effects**: Subtle 1.05x scale for idle states
- **Floating Effects**: -5pt offset with gentle breathing
- **Shake Effects**: Error feedback with haptic integration

### **Contextual Status Indicators**
```swift
// Dynamic status system
AdaptiveStatusIndicator(
    status: .recording(duration: 15),      // Animated waveform
    status: .processing(elapsed: 12.3),    // Progress with timer
    status: .playing,                      // Pulsing speaker icon
    status: .idle,                         // Breathing "Tap to speak"
    onCancel: cancelTranslation
)
```

## ‚ôø **Accessibility Excellence**
