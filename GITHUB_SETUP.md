# GitHub Repository Setup Guide

## 🚀 Quick Setup Instructions

Your VoiceBridge iOS app is ready to be pushed to GitHub! Follow these steps:

### Option 1: Create New Repository on GitHub.com

1. **Go to GitHub.com** and sign in to your account
2. **Click "New repository"** (green button or + icon)
3. **Repository settings**:
   - **Repository name**: `voicebridge-ios` or `universal-translator-app`
   - **Description**: `VoiceBridge - Voice-to-voice translation iOS app with Firebase integration`
   - **Visibility**: Choose Public or Private
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)

4. **Copy the repository URL** (will look like: `https://github.com/yourusername/voicebridge-ios.git`)

### Option 2: Use GitHub CLI (if installed)

```bash
# Create repository directly from command line
gh repo create voicebridge-ios --public --description "VoiceBridge - Voice-to-voice translation iOS app"
```

## 📤 Push Your Code

Once you have the repository URL, run these commands:

```bash
# Add your GitHub repository as remote origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/voicebridge-ios.git

# Push all commits to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `yourusername/voicebridge-ios` with your actual GitHub username and repository name.

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Authentication Issues
```bash
# If you get authentication errors, set up GitHub credentials:
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"

# For HTTPS, you may need a personal access token instead of password
```

### Repository Already Exists
```bash
# If repository exists and you want to overwrite:
git push --force origin main
```

### Large File Warnings
All files in this project are within GitHub's size limits, but if you get warnings:
- App icons and screenshots are optimized for size
- No large binary files included
- Archive builds are not included in git (as intended)
