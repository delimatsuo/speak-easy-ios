## 🔧 Current Issue & Fix

The service is deployed but experiencing an authentication issue with Google credentials. This is a common Cloud Run issue. Here's the fix:

### Quick Fix - Redeploy with proper service account:
```bash
# Grant default service account access to secrets
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding universal-translator-prod \
    --member="serviceAccount:932729595834@cloudbuild.gserviceaccount.com" \
    --role="roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor"

# Redeploy with explicit service account
gcloud run services update universal-translator-api \
    --service-account=932729595834-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com \
    --region=us-central1
```

## 📱 Next Steps for iOS App

### 1. Update your iOS app with the API URL:
```swift
// In AppConfig.swift or your configuration file
let API_BASE_URL = "https://universal-translator-api-932729595834.us-central1.run.app"
```

### 2. Test the API endpoints:
```bash
# Test translation (once auth is fixed)
curl -X POST https://universal-translator-api-932729595834.us-central1.run.app/v1/translate \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"text":"Hello","source_language":"en","target_language":"es"}'

# Get supported languages
curl https://universal-translator-api-932729595834.us-central1.run.app/v1/languages
