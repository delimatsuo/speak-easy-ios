# TestFlight Translation Failure Fix Documentation

## Issue Summary
Users on TestFlight builds were experiencing intermittent translation failures with the error "Translation service is currently unavailable. Please try again later." while debug builds in Xcode worked perfectly.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Health Check Failures
- The app was performing a health check before every translation request
- Health checks were failing in TestFlight due to network/timing issues
- When health check failed, the app would throw a generic error instead of attempting translation

### 2. Network Security Manager Restrictions
- NetworkSecurityManager was not explicitly trusting the Cloud Run API domain
- Certificate pinning was too restrictive for Google Cloud Run's rotating certificates
- Release builds had stricter security checks that blocked API requests

### 3. Speech Recognition Authorization Issues
- The app was requesting SFSpeechRecognizer authorization twice (startup + transcription)
- This double authorization request was causing kAFAssistantErrorDomain 1101 errors
- The speech recognition entitlement was incorrectly configured

### 4. Audio Session Configuration
- Audio session was using default mode which could conflict with other apps
- Missing Bluetooth audio support for AirPods and other devices
- Insufficient error handling when audio recording failed to start

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Removed Pre-Translation Health Check
**File**: `iOS/TranslationService.swift`
- Removed unnecessary health check before translation
- Direct translation attempts with proper retry logic
- Health checks added unnecessary latency and failure points

### 2. Fixed Network Security Manager
**File**: `iOS/Utilities/NetworkSecurityManager.swift`
- Explicitly added `universal-translator-api-jzqoowo3tq-uc.a.run.app` to trusted hosts
- Added wildcard trust for all `*.run.app` Cloud Run domains
- Added special handling to bypass certificate pinning for Cloud Run API
- Improved logging for debugging connection issues

### 3. Fixed Speech Recognition Flow
**File**: `iOS/AudioManager.swift`
- Changed to check authorization status instead of requesting again
- Added timeout handling for speech recognition tasks
- Improved error detection for kAFAssistantErrorDomain 1101
- Added detailed logging for transcription failures

**File**: `iOS/UniversalTranslator/UniversalTranslator.entitlements`
- Removed problematic `com.apple.developer.speech-recognition` entitlement
- This custom entitlement was causing provisioning issues

### 4. Improved Audio Session Setup
**File**: `iOS/AudioManager.swift`
- Changed audio session mode from `.default` to `.measurement` (better for speech)
- Added `.allowBluetooth` option for better device compatibility
- Added check for available audio inputs before recording
- Improved error handling with detailed logging

### 5. Enhanced Error Handling
**File**: `iOS/ContentView.swift`
- Added explicit microphone permission check before recording
- Credit refund if recording fails to start
- More descriptive error messages for users
- Detailed logging throughout the recording/translation flow

## Testing Recommendations

### Debug Testing
1. Test with local STT enabled and disabled
2. Test with various network conditions
3. Test with different audio input devices (built-in mic, AirPods, etc.)
4. Test permission denial scenarios

### TestFlight Testing
1. Verify recording starts without errors
2. Confirm local STT works when available
3. Test server STT fallback when local fails
4. Verify translation completes successfully
5. Test with poor network conditions

## Monitoring

### Key Log Messages to Monitor
- `‚úÖ Audio session activated successfully` - Recording setup succeeded
- `üéôÔ∏è Using local STT` vs `üì° Using server STT` - Which STT path is used
- `‚úÖ Translation successful!` - End-to-end success
- `‚úÖ Allowing Cloud Run host` - Network security allowing API

### Error Patterns to Watch
- `kAFAssistantErrorDomain 1101` - Speech recognition service unavailable
- `Network error` - Connection issues with API
- `Certificate validation failed` - TLS/SSL issues

## Deployment Process

1. Build with Release configuration in Xcode
2. Archive and upload to App Store Connect
3. Wait for processing (10-30 minutes)
4. Test on multiple TestFlight devices
5. Monitor crash reports and feedback

## Future Improvements

1. Implement offline translation capability
2. Add connection pre-warming on app launch
3. Cache successful translations for replay
4. Add network reachability monitoring
5. Implement progressive retry with exponential backoff
