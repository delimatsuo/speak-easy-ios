# watchOS Companion App Implementation

## Overview
The Universal Translator watchOS companion app provides a convenient way to use the translation service directly from Apple Watch. The app uses Option B architecture where the Watch handles recording and playback locally while the iPhone processes translations.

## Architecture

### Option B: Watch Records/Plays Locally, iPhone Processes
- **Recording**: Done locally on Watch using AVAudioRecorder
- **Playback**: Done locally on Watch using AVAudioPlayer  
- **Processing**: All speech-to-text and translation handled by iPhone
- **Transport**: WatchConnectivity framework for Watch-iPhone communication
- **Storage**: No conversation history stored (privacy-first)

## Components

### Watch App
- `UniversalTranslatorWatchApp.swift` - Main app entry point
- `ContentView.swift` - Watch UI with recording states
- `WatchAudioManager.swift` - Audio recording/playback manager
- `WatchConnectivityManager.swift` - iPhone communication handler

### iPhone Integration
- `WatchSessionManager.swift` - Watch request processor
- Reuses existing `TranslationService` and `AudioManager`
- Syncs credits and language preferences

### Shared Models
- `TranslationRequest.swift` - Request structure
- `TranslationResponse.swift` - Response structure
- `AudioConstants.swift` - Audio configuration
- `TranslationError.swift` - Error types

## Features

### Implemented
✅ Audio recording on Watch (up to 30 seconds)
✅ Audio playback on Watch
✅ WatchConnectivity communication
✅ Language synchronization
✅ Credits display and sync
✅ Error handling
✅ Privacy-compliant (no storage)

### State Flow
1. **Idle** - Ready to record
2. **Recording** - Capturing audio
3. **Sending** - Transferring to iPhone
4. **Processing** - iPhone translating
5. **Playing** - Playing translation
6. **Error** - Display error message

## Setup Instructions

1. **Open Xcode Project**
   ```bash
   open iOS/UniversalTranslator.xcodeproj
   ```

2. **Configure Signing**
   - Select "UniversalTranslator Watch App" target
   - Configure Team and Bundle ID
   - Enable automatic signing

3. **Build and Run**
   - Select Watch App scheme
   - Choose Watch simulator or device
   - Build and run (⌘R)

4. **Test Communication**
   - Run both iPhone and Watch apps
   - Tap microphone on Watch
   - Verify translation works

## Technical Details

### Audio Settings
- Format: MPEG4 AAC
- Sample Rate: 44.1 kHz
- Channels: Mono
- Max Duration: 30 seconds
- Quality: High

### Communication
- Uses `WCSession` for messaging
- File transfer for audio > 100KB
- Message transfer for smaller data
- Application context for sync

### Privacy
- No conversation history stored
- Temporary files cleaned after use
- Audio deleted after processing
- Complies with app privacy policy

## Troubleshooting

### Watch Not Connected
- Ensure both apps are running
- Check Watch paired in iPhone Settings
- Restart both apps if needed

### No Audio Recording
- Check microphone permissions on Watch
- Ensure audio session is configured
- Verify recording URL is valid

### Translation Fails
- Check iPhone has network connection
- Verify credits available
- Ensure languages are synced

## Future Enhancements
- Complications for quick access
- Siri shortcuts integration
- Independent Watch operation (Option C)
- Multiple language quick switch
- Offline translation caching
